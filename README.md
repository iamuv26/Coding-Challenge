# 👨‍💻 Engineering Journal: C++ & Web Development

## 📖 About This Repository
Welcome to my coding portfolio. This repository serves as a dual-track record of my continuous growth as a software engineer, capturing both my algorithmic problem-solving journey and my practical application development skills.

It is divided into two core sections:

### 1. 🧠 Computational Logic (C++)
*Focused on Data Structures, Algorithms, and System Efficiency.*

This directory documents my progression from functional programming to advanced **Object-Oriented Design**.
* **Core Concepts:** Implementation of advanced Loop logic, Arrays, and Strings.
* **OOP Mastery:** Practical use of **Classes, Inheritance, Polymorphism, and Templates** to write modular, reusable code.
* **Optimization:** Solutions focused on reducing Time and Space complexity.

### 2. 🌐 Web Development (Weekly Projects)
*Focused on Building, Deployment, and User Interface.*

This directory tracks my weekly progress in building responsive and interactive web applications.
* **Frontend & UI:** Translating designs into functional interfaces (HTML/CSS/JS).
* **Functionality:** Implementing dynamic features and state management.
* **Consistency:** A chronological log of projects demonstrating rapid skill acquisition and consistent coding discipline.
